	\vspace*{0.5em}
	His Majesty the Emperor of China hereby agrees that the ambassador, minister, or other diplomatic agent, so appointed by Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain, may reside, with his family and establishment, permanently at the capital, or may visit it occasionally, at the option of the British Government. He shall not be called upon to perform any ceremony derogatory to him as representing the Sovereign of an independent nation on a footing of equality with that of China. On the other hand, he shall use the same forms of ceremony and respect to His Majesty the Emperor as are employed by the ambassadors, ministers, or diplomatic agents of Her Majesty towards the Sovereigns of independent and equal European nations.
	
	It is further agreed, that Her Majesty's Government may acquire at Peking\footnote{Peking is the classical romanisation of Beijing.} a site for building, or may hire houses for the accommodation of Her Majesty's Mission, and that the Chinese Government will assist it in so doing.
	
	Her Majesty's Representative shall be at liberty to choose his own servants and attendants, who shall not be subjected to any kind of molestation whatever.
	
	Any person guilty of disrespect or violence to Her Majesty's Representative, or to any member of his family or establishment, in deed or word, shall be severely punished.

	\articlehead{[\ldots] Russia --- Article VIII [\ldots]}
	The Chinese government, recognizing that Christian doctrine contributes to the establishment of order and harmony between people, undertakes not only not to persecute its subjects for fulfilling the duties of the Christian faith, but also to patronize them on a par with those who follow other beliefs admitted in the state. \emph{[\ldots]}
