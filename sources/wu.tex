	The \textit{Taiping Rebellion}, which lasted from 1850 to 1864, represents the type of rebellion which possessed revolutionary characteristics. It aimed not only at unseating the Manchus from the throne, but sought to establish a new economic and social order. Although the \textit{Taiping Rebellion} was finally suppressed, its impact upon the existing Manchu order, especially its fiscal system, was great. The Manchu government was forced by the rebellion into a series of changes and reforms which fundamentally altered the power structure of China and paved the way for the revolutionary movements of the following century.
